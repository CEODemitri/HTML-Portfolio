# I love to Code ðŸ¤“ðŸ”°
`code` const thank_you = 'Welcome to my Legendary HTML Site. Plain Jain as I can be';

## Slowly Updating. One of my favorite sites I Have built. Very little CSS ( I am an artist first so that was extremely tough to ignore )

### I had to add my HTML site to my portfolio to keep the trend up going. Learning in Progress -Obvious-.
