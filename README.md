# All About Structure ðŸ¤“ðŸ”°
` <div>Welcome to my Legendary HTML Site. Plain Jain as I can be</div> `

## Slowly Updating. 
One of my favorite/first sites I Have built. Alt, nur very much alive. Very little CSS ( I am an artist first so that was extremely tough to ignore ). Build a cool HTML only site. 

### Goal 
1. can the style attribute be used without breaking no CSS rules?
2. make a good looking site 
3. showcase sÃ¶me of mein web dev skills, no matter the tools, i can produce.

### Accomplished 
keep the CS tradition going. 



Learning in Progress -Obvious-.
