# Focus: Structure ðŸ¤“ðŸ”°
` <h1>Welcome to my Legendary HTML Site. Plain Jain one hundred percent.</h1> `

## Forever Updating. 
One of my favorite/first sites I Have built. Alt, but very much alive. Very little CSS ( I am an artist first; extreme minimal use of some styling). 

## Goal of Project
1. can the style attribute be used without breaking no CSS rules?
[update] No. All styling is CSS, point blank.
rhetoric question; simple quest for me to aquire more knowledge.
2. make a good looking site 
3. showcase mein web dev skills.
no matter the tools, i can produce.
4. keep the CS tradition going. 


Learning in Progress.
