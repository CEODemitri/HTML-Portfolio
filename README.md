# Simple Code is the Best ðŸ¤“ðŸ”°
` const thank_you = 'Welcome to my Legendary HTML Site. Plain Jain as I can be'; `

## Slowly Updating. One of my favorite sites I Have built. Very little CSS ( I am an artist first so that was extremely tough to ignore )

### Adding my HTML site to the long list of portfolios to keep the CS trend going. Learning in Progress -Obvious-.
